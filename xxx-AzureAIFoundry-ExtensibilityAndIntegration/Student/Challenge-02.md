[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

***This is a template for a single challenge. The italicized text provides hints & examples of what should or should NOT go in each section.  You should remove all italicized & sample text and replace with your content.***

## Pre-requisites (Optional)

*Your hack's "Challenge 0" should cover pre-requisites for the entire hack, and thus this section is optional and may be omitted.  If you wish to spell out specific previous challenges that must be completed before starting this challenge, you may do so here.*

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will deploy and integrate **custom AI models** in **Azure AI** to generate specialized, industry-specific responses with enhanced contextual accuracy. This challenge will provide experience in **fine-tuning AI models**, improving conversational AI, and enabling continuous learning for adaptive intelligence.

## Description

Your goal is to implement **custom AI models** in **Azure AI** to enhance response accuracy and create agentic AI. You will:

- Deploy **custom AI models** trained on industry-specific datasets.
- Integrate models with **Azure AI services** to generate contextually accurate responses.
- Optimize **natural language understanding (NLU)** for improved AI conversations.
- Implement **continuous learning mechanisms** to refine model accuracy based on evolving data trends.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Deploy **custom AI models** within **Azure AI** and validate proper functionality.
- Demonstrate that **industry-specific AI responses** are generated accurately.
- Show that **natural language processing (NLP) improvements** enhance response quality.
- Verify that the AI model can **continuously learn and adapt** based on new data trends.

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*

*Sample IoT resource links:*

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
