# Challenge 01 - Enterprise AI Search

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Pre-requisites (Optional)

*Your hack's "Challenge 0" should cover pre-requisites for the entire hack, and thus this section is optional and may be omitted.  If you wish to spell out specific previous challenges that must be completed before starting this challenge, you may do so here.*

## Introduction

In this challenge, you will set up **Azure AI Search**, index enterprise data, and optimize queries to enhance search accuracy and retrieval efficiency. You will gain hands-on experience with AI-powered search capabilities that improve knowledge retrieval and enable intelligent responses.

## Description

Your goal is to implement **Azure AI Search** to provide scalable and optimized knowledge retrieval. You will:

- Set up **Azure AI Search** and configure it for enterprise data indexing.
- Index enterprise data efficiently and at scale to enhance retrieval performance.
- Optimize search queries using **AI-powered ranking and semantic search**.
- Integrate data from sources such as **Azure Blob Storage, ADLS Gen2, Azure Cosmos DB, and Microsoft Fabric OneLake**.
- Ensure that security and compliance measures are in place for data access control.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that **Azure AI Search** is properly set up and configured.
- Demonstrate that **enterprise data** is indexed and searchable.
- Show that **optimized queries** return relevant and accurate search results.
- Confirm that **security and access controls** are in place for sensitive data.
- Validate that **retrieval performance** is optimized using AI-powered search capabilities.


## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*

*Sample IoT resource links:*

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
