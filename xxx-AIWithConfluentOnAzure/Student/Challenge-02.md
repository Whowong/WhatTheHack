# Challenge 02 - Configuration of Chat Interface and Frontend

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)


## Pre-requisites

You must complete **Challenge 01** before starting this challenge. The backend API must be successfully deployed and reachable, as the frontend will depend on it for communication and functionality.

## Introduction

In this challenge, you'll configure and deploy the frontend user interface that interacts with your backend API. This frontend UI will allow users to send and receive messages to the AI agent powered by real-time streaming data from Confluent Cloud. **Need to update as I am just filling in generic verbiage**


## Description

**Need to Update as we get details of infrastructure.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Verify that the IoT device boots properly after its thingamajig is configured.
- Verify that the thingamajig can connect to the mothership.
- Demonstrate that the thingamajic will not connect to the IoTProxyShip

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*

*Sample IoT resource links:*

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
