# Challenge 01 - Introduction to GitHub Copilot

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Pre-requisites

Ensure that GitHub Copilot is installed in your IDE as part of Challenge 0. This challenge assumes that you have Copilot ready and functioning in your IDE.


## Introduction

Now that you've installed GitHub Copilot, it's time to delve into its capabilities. In this challenge, you'll write your first program with the help of Copilot and explore how it can assist you in this task.


## Description

The aim is to construct a "Quote of the Day" application and see how Copilot can help you on this journey.  As you progress, focus on how Copilot:

- **Boosts Productivity**: Observe how Copilot accelerates your development process, especially in crafting boilerplate code, or setting up project structures.
- **Understanding Contextual Sensitivity**: Pay close attention to how context influences Copilot's behavior, whether it be your coding style, the changes you make, and the context you provide. See how its suggestions evolve based on your interactions.
- **Interaction Flexibility**: Explore different ways to interact with Copilot. Whether it's accepting, modifying, or rejecting its suggestions, discover how each interaction molds the development experience.
- **Refining Suggestions**: Learn to effectively modify Copilot's suggestions. See how it responds to your changes and note how it aligns its subsequent suggestions with your coding style and preferences.


This challenge invites you to engage with Copilot's recommendations actively, integrating the ones that elevate your project while critically evaluating its limitations.

## Success Criteria

You have successfully completed this challenge when you can:

- The "Quote of the Day" application functions correctly, displaying a new quote upon each interaction.
- You can describe how GitHub Copilot assisted in the development process, providing specific examples of its contributions.
- Show the different ways you interacted with GitHub Copilot, you should be able to show at least 3 different ways.
- Show the strategies that you leveraged highlighting how your inputs and modifications steered its suggestions while using Copilot.

## Learning Resources

- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

## Tips

- Take note of how Copilotâ€™s suggestions can vary greatly depending on the context of your code and the specific language syntax.
- If Copilot's suggestions don't immediately align with your expectations, experiment with adjusting your code or comments to give it better context.
- Remember, Copilot is a tool to aid your coding, not to replace the need for understanding the code itself. Use this opportunity to learn and understand the suggestions it provides.
