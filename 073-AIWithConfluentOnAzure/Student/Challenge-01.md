# Challenge 01 - Configuration of Agentic Resources and Deployment of Backend

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-02.md)

## Introduction

In this challenge, you'll focus on deploying the backend API that will serve as the foundation for your real-time AI agent. This API will eventually consume data streamed through Confluent Cloud on Azure and surface intelligent responses based on the latest available information.

## Description

*Need to Update once we confirm architecture*


## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:
- Show that your Azure resources and API have been deployed
- Verify that the API is reachable and responsive.

## Learning Resources

_List of relevant links and online articles that should give the attendees the knowledge needed to complete the challenge._

*Think of this list as giving the students a head start on some easy Internet searches. However, try not to include documentation links that are the literal step-by-step answer of the challenge's scenario.*

***Note:** Use descriptive text for each link instead of just URLs.*

*Sample IoT resource links:*

- [What is a Thingamajig?](https://www.bing.com/search?q=what+is+a+thingamajig)
- [10 Tips for Never Forgetting Your Thingamajic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- [IoT & Thingamajigs: Together Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPYZpwSpKmA)

## Tips

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Add tips and hints here to give students food for thought. Sample IoT tips:*

- IoTDevices can fail from a broken heart if they are not together with their thingamajig. Your device will display a broken heart emoji on its screen if this happens.
- An IoTDevice can have one or more thingamajigs attached which allow them to connect to multiple networks.

## Advanced Challenges (Optional)

*If you want, you may provide additional goals to this challenge for folks who are eager.*

*This section is optional and may be omitted.*

*Sample IoT advanced challenges:*

Too comfortable?  Eager to do more?  Try these additional challenges!

- Observe what happens if your IoTDevice is separated from its thingamajig.
- Configure your IoTDevice to connect to BOTH the mothership and IoTQueenBee at the same time.
