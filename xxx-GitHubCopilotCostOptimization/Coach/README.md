# What The Hack - GitHub Copilot Cost Optimization - Coach Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the coach's guide for the GitHub Copilot Cost Optimization What The Hack. Here you will find links to specific guidance for coaches for each of the challenges.

This hack teaches teams to maximize code quality while minimizing GitHub Copilot credit spend under usage-based billing (UBB). The focus is on practical engineering techniques: context engineering, model selection, session hygiene, and spec-driven development.

**NOTE:** If you are a Hackathon participant, this is the answer guide. Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack! Go learn something. :)

## Coach's Guides

- Challenge 00: **[Prerequisites & Baseline](./Solution-00.md)**
   - Set up the hack environment and establish baseline credit spend measurements
- Challenge 01: **[Context Engineering](./Solution-01.md)**
   - Optimize instruction architecture and attachment precision
- Challenge 02: **[Model Selection & Output Constraints](./Solution-02.md)**
   - Compare models and apply output constraints to reduce costs
- Challenge 03: **[Session Configuration (Tools + Cache)](./Solution-03.md)**
   - Manage MCP tool sprawl and understand cache invalidation
- Challenge 04: **[Context Window Management](./Solution-04.md)**
   - Use /compact proactively to maintain quality and control costs
- Challenge 05: **[Spec-Driven Development](./Solution-05.md)**
   - Leverage deterministic controls as token controls
- Challenge 06: **[Token Golf Competition](./Solution-06.md)**
   - Competitive coding challenge optimizing for lowest credit spend

## Coach Prerequisites

This hack has pre-reqs that a coach is responsible for understanding and/or setting up BEFORE hosting an event. Please review the [What The Hack Hosting Guide](https://aka.ms/wthhost) for information on how to host a hack event.

The guide covers the common preparation steps a coach needs to do before any What The Hack event, including how to properly configure Microsoft Teams.

### Student Resources

Before the hack, it is the Coach's responsibility to download and package up the contents of the `/Student/Resources` folder of this hack into a "Resources.zip" file. The coach should then provide a copy of the Resources.zip file to all students at the start of the hack.

The Student/Resources folder should contain:

- **Starter codebase** with intentionally sub-optimal GitHub Copilot configuration:
  - Bloated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (~1500 tokens) for Challenge 01
  - Multiple MCP tools enabled (some unnecessary) for Challenge 03
  - Sample code with opportunities for spec-first vs. trial-and-error comparison
- **Baseline coding task** (baseline-task.md) for Challenge 00
- **Token Golf task specification** for Challenge 06 with acceptance criteria

Always refer students to the [What The Hack website](https://aka.ms/wth) for the student guide: [https://aka.ms/wth](https://aka.ms/wth)

**NOTE:** Students should **not** be given a link to the What The Hack repo before or during a hack. The student guide does **NOT** have any links to the Coach's guide or the What The Hack repo on GitHub.

### Additional Coach Prerequisites

**Coach must complete Challenge 06 (Token Golf) before the hack:**

- Complete the Token Golf coding task yourself to establish "par" score
- Document your credit spend and techniques used
- This "par" becomes the benchmark teams compete against

**Prepare measurement tools:**

- Confirm all students have UBB enabled on their GitHub Copilot subscriptions
- Verify token visibility in VS Code Output panel (GitHub Copilot Chat)
- Test access to GitHub Copilot usage dashboard

## Azure Requirements

This hack does not require Azure resources. All work is done locally with GitHub Copilot in Visual Studio Code.
