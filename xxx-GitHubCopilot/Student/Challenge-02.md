# Challenge 02 - Best Practices When Using Copilot

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction
Having explored the capabilities of GitHub Copilot, it's now time to refine your approach and adopt best practices that will make your experience with Copilot even more productive. This challenge will focus on strategies for interacting with Copilot effectively.

## Description
In this challenge, you'll focus on learning best practices for working with GitHub Copilot. You'll learn the art of prompt engineering, which involves crafting inputs that guide Copilot to provide the most relevant and helpful suggestions. Below are some to take into consideration:

- **Craft Well-Defined Requests**: Understand the importance of clear and concise communication. Grasp how articulating detailed, well-defined requests can steer Copilot to offer more accurate and beneficial suggestions, aligning closely with your coding objectives.

- **Keep It Simple and Specific**: Simplify complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks. Copilot tends to generate more precise and practical solutions when dealing with focused queries rather than broad, vague ones.

- **Give Examples**: Provide some examples of what you are looking for which can help Copilot grasp the context and the specific pattern you're aiming for. 


## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

1. Demonstrate the differences before and after leveraging prompt engineering techniques.

## Learning Resources
- [GitHub Copilot Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot)

## Tips
- Context comes in many forms for Copilot.  Not only does it take context from what is around the cursor but also the filename and the other open tabs.
