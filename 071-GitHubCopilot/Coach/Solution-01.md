# Challenge 01 - Introduction to GitHub Copilot - Coach's Guide 

[< Previous Solution](./Solution-00.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution-02.md)

## Notes & Guidance

- We give the students 2 options to do the hack.  A language they are familiar with or a new language.  This is because these are two very common scenarios that we see developers leverage Copilot for.
  - A developer who is focused on a specific language can see how Copilot can assist them with their daily tasks such as boilerplate code.
  - A developer who switches languages or may be learning a new language can see how Copilot can help with that transition.
- GitHub Copilot Chat is extremely powerful and can cover the majority of this challenge on its own in a few seconds.  A simple prompt of "Can you help me create a quote of the day app in *insert language* calling the zenquotes.io endpoint to get the quotes?" will do all or most of the work for them.  However we want them to interact with Copilot a bit more.  They are open to add features if they need more content to go through all the scenarios below or just generate sandbox code that will be deleted later.
- If they want to use an API to get quotes, they can use https://zenquotes.io, its free and you don't even need to sign up.  Using an API isn't required.
- Some ways to interact with Copilot
  - Copilot Chat
  - Copilot within the IDE as they write code
  - Inline chat, you can do this by right clicking at a specific line and selecting Copilot then choosing an option there
  - Ctrl + enter - Copilot can provide longer and up to 10 suggestions
