# Challenge 00 - Prerequisites & Baseline

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-01.md)

## Introduction

Thank you for participating in the GitHub Copilot Cost Optimization What The Hack. Before you begin optimizing, you need to set up your environment to measure GitHub Copilot usage costs accurately. This challenge establishes your baseline—the "before" measurement that all subsequent challenges will compare against.

Understanding where credits go is essential to optimization. In this challenge, you'll confirm that usage-based billing (UBB) is active, learn how to read token breakdowns in VS Code, and complete a baseline coding task to capture your starting credit spend.

## Description

Your coach will provide you with a Resources.zip file that contains a starter codebase for this hack. The codebase is intentionally configured with sub-optimal GitHub Copilot settings—you'll be optimizing these in later challenges.

Please complete the following setup steps:

1. Extract the Resources.zip file to your local workstation
2. Open Visual Studio Code and install/update the GitHub Copilot extension to the latest version
3. Verify your GitHub Copilot subscription has usage-based billing (UBB) enabled by checking your billing settings
4. Enable token usage visibility in VS Code:
   - Open the Output panel (View > Output)
   - Select "GitHub Copilot Chat" from the dropdown
   - Verify you can see token counts and credit usage per interaction
5. Confirm you can access your GitHub Copilot usage dashboard to view cumulative credit spend
6. Open the starter codebase in VS Code and familiarize yourself with its structure

### Baseline Measurement

Once your environment is configured, complete the baseline coding task:

1. Locate the `baseline-task.md` file in the `/Challenge00/` folder of the Resources.zip
2. Complete the coding task described using GitHub Copilot Chat in your normal working style (don't optimize yet!)
3. Record the total credits consumed for this task from the VS Code Output panel
4. Document your approach: which features you used (inline completions, chat, edits, workspace references)
5. Save your baseline measurements—you'll compare all future challenges against this

This baseline represents your "before" state. In subsequent challenges, you'll apply optimization techniques and measure the credit reduction compared to this baseline.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Verify that usage-based billing (UBB) is active on your GitHub Copilot subscription
- Demonstrate that the VS Code Output panel shows token breakdowns for GitHub Copilot interactions
- Show that you can access the GitHub Copilot usage dashboard and view your current credit consumption
- Verify that the starter codebase from Resources.zip is open in VS Code
- Demonstrate that you have completed the baseline coding task and recorded the credit spend
- Show your documented baseline measurements including total credits and approach used
