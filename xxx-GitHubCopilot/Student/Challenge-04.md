# Challenge 04 - Leveraging Copilot for Test Case and Documentation

[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-03.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-05.md)

## Introduction
In this next challenge, you'll take your application to the next level by adding a new feature of your choice. But it doesn't stop there â€“ you'll also ensure the robustness of your application by using GitHub Copilot to generate meaningful test cases and leverage Copilot to help with documentation. This challenge is about enhancing functionality, securing quality, and improving ease of maintenance.

## Description
Expand the functionality of your application by introducing a new feature. It could be anything from improving user interaction, adding data visualization, or integrating a new API. After implementing the new feature, focus on ensuring the quality and stability of your application by leveraging GitHub Copilot to generate test cases. Your tasks are to:

- **Feature Enhancement**: Brainstorm and implement a new feature that adds value to your application. Use Copilot to get suggestions on implementing the feature, ensuring that it integrates seamlessly with your existing codebase.
- **Generate Test Cases**: With the new feature in place, use Copilot to assist in creating comprehensive test cases. Focus on covering a wide range of scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure your application's robustness.
- **Document Your Application**: Add in documentation and comments to make your application easier to maintain for the next developer.
- **Include in CI Pipeline**: After generating the test cases, include them in your CI pipeline.

This challenge is not just about coding but also about thinking about application quality and maintainability. It's an opportunity to see how Copilot can contribute to these aspects of software development.

## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

1. Show that you have successfully integrated a new feature into your application.
2. Show your test cases generated with the assistance of Copilot, covering both the existing and newly added functionalities.
3. Show that your test cases are integrated into your CI Pipeline.
4. Show the documentation you have added to your application.
