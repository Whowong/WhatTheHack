[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge-01.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge-03.md)

## Introduction
Now that you've gotten a taste of GitHub Copilot's capabilities, it's time to dive deeper into how to effectively harness this tool. This challenge focuses on honing your ability to work with Copilot, enhancing your development process through strategic use of its features.

## Description
In this challenge, you'll explore strategies to maximize the benefits of GitHub Copilot in your coding workflow. Rather than focusing on complexity of code, you'll concentrate on the depth of interaction with Copilot. You'll learn to fine-tune its suggestions to fit your coding style and requirements, and understand how subtle changes in your approach can significantly influence Copilot's output. Focus on:

- **Optimizing Interaction**: Engage with Copilot's suggestions for a variety of coding tasks. Experiment with different ways of describing your coding goals and see how it affects the suggestions you receive.
- **Understanding Contextual Sensitivity**: Pay close attention to how context influences Copilot's behavior. Provide varied levels of detail and observe how it adapts its suggestions, aiming to understand the 'how' and 'why' behind its operations.
- **Refining Suggestions**: Learn to effectively modify Copilot's suggestions. See how it responds to your changes and note how it aligns its subsequent suggestions with your coding style and preferences.

This challenge is about mastering the art of working with an AI pair programmer, learning to guide and utilize its suggestions in the most effective way.

## Success Criteria
You will have successfully completed this challenge when you:

1. Can demonstrate proficiency in interacting with GitHub Copilot, effectively guiding it to align with your coding objectives.
2. Demonstrate an understanding of how context and coding style influence Copilot's suggestions.
3. Show the strategies that you leveraged highlighting how your inputs and modifications steered its suggestions while using Copilot.
